## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both frontend and backend directories:

**Backend (.env):**
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Frontend (.env):**
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG=your_firebase_config
```

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 3000 (frontend) and 5000 (backend) are available
- **Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in both directories if modules are missing
- **API errors**: Check that backend server is running before starting frontend
- **Build issues**: Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies

### Development Tips
